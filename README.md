A culmination of blog posts for my experience in learning about Haskell and various concepts within programming languages in general.

Through taking the programming languages course, I found that becoming fully comfortable with the various concepts we learned about was essential for success in this class. With this, many of my blogs are intended to provide a simple explanation and tips for practicng with various concepts both from a definition sort of standpoint, and more concrete standpoint where examples are practiced.

## Blog Post One

## Blog Post Ten
### Topic: Hoare Logic

#### Ending Remarks:

Blog Ten covered the topic I was most interested in. As a software engineering major, it was exciting to see a concept that I first thought was very niche and relating very specificly to theoretical computing apply to a large concept in software engineering. With this, I think it would be very interesting to research the parallels between software development processes, lifecyles, and even design patterns, in relation to the nitty gritty details that relate to theoretical computing overall, ARS's, or even Lambda Calculus. 

I thorouhgly enjoyed my time taking the programming languages course, and I think it provided for a larger view of computing overall and even software engineering. I hope this blog is helpful to anyone taking the course!

Best,
